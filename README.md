Repository for Django Dash 2012.

If I ever get heroku to work, the app will appear at http://peaceful-atoll-3989.herokuapp.com/.

sigh.

tamli is a pathetically generic social bookmarking app, crushed into mediocrity by high expectations and unfamiliar tools

known bugs:

* the subscribe links won't go away on the me+subs tab, whyyy
* me + subscriptions tab bookmarks are in the opposite order, concatenating querysets sucks
* external pings and actual federation architecture need to exist
* pagination, what
* password changes / account email / etc etc
* ugly-ass fonts / actual site graphics
